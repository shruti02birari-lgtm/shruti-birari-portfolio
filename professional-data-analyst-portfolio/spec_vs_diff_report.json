  "summary": "The diff implements the requested single-page portfolio structure with dark theme styling and the required sections (Hero, Skills, Projects, Experience, Contact) plus responsive navigation and smooth scrolling. However, the required dashboard illustration is not evidenced as being rendered, and the presence of all required generated image files under the specified public assets path cannot be confirmed from the provided diff summary. Additionally, Internet Identity/auth-related infrastructure and a promotional footer link were added despite being non-goals/not requested.",

      "reason": "Hero background and three project thumbnails are referenced, but the required dashboard illustration image (dashboard-illustration.dim_1200x800.png) is not shown as referenced or rendered anywhere in the visible diff summary.",
