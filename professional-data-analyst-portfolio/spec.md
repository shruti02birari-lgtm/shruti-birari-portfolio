# Specification

## Summary
**Goal:** Build a professional, single-page dark-theme data analyst portfolio with smooth in-page navigation, showcasing skills, projects, experience, and contact info.

**Planned changes:**
- Create a single-page layout with a top navigation (Home, Skills, Projects, Experience, Contact) and smooth scrolling to sections with proper header offset.
- Implement a modern, cohesive dark theme (charcoal base with restrained teal/amber accents), consistent typography, spacing, and interactive states.
- Build a responsive Hero section highlighting 2+ years of experience and key skills/tools (R, Power BI, SQL, Python, data visualization, statistical analysis) with CTAs to view projects and contact.
- Add a grouped Skills section (at minimum Tools and Core Competencies) with a clean, scannable layout.
- Add a Projects section with at least 3 sample project/case-study cards including title, problem, approach, tools, and outcomes/insights (realistic placeholders).
- Add an Experience timeline with at least 2 entries (2–4 impact bullets each) reflecting 2+ years progression (realistic placeholders).
- Add a Contact section with email and at least one additional channel link (e.g., LinkedIn/GitHub) using safe English placeholders and accessible styling.
- Incorporate locally bundled data-visualization-themed imagery (hero image plus project thumbnails) and reference assets from `/assets/generated/...`.
- Ensure responsive behavior across mobile/tablet/desktop with no overflow, readable typography, and touch-friendly navigation/cards/timeline.

**User-visible outcome:** A polished, responsive dark-mode portfolio page with navigable sections, data-visualization imagery, and complete content areas for skills, projects, experience, and contact.
